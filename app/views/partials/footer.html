                <p>
                    Important Disclosure:
                </p>
                <p>
                    PelotonStreet.com is a website operated by Peloton Street, LLC. Equity securities are offered through WealthForge, LLC, a registered broker/dealer and member FINRA/SIPC. By accessing or using the PelotonStreet.com website or any service provided by Peloton Street, including mobile applications made available by Peloton Street, however accessed, you agree to be bound by our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to be bound by all of these Terms of Service, do not access or use the website or other services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Peloton Street, as the manager of certain pooled investment vehicles, will manage and control all of the capital privately invested through our platform, provided that no communication through this website should be construed as investment advice. The level of control that Peloton Street will have may be different from deal-to-deal, depending on the aggregate size of and/or any negotiations that we may have had with individual deal sponsors regarding the terms of conditions of our investment – the details of which would be furnished in the definitive documentation that would by U.S. law need to accompany an offer to buy or a solicitation of an offer to make an investment. No such offer or solicitation will be made prior to the delivery of definitive documentation relating to the matters herein.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Investment opportunities offered on our online marketplace are intended for accredited investors only (for persons residing in the U.S.) and for persons residing abroad in jurisdictions where securities registration exemptions may be applicable or apply. In most cases, our investments will be structured as “private placements” under Rule 506 of Regulation D, which is considered a “safe harbor” for private offerings in the Securities Act of 1933. Securities issued under Rule 506 of Regulation D are not publicly traded and are intended only for investors who do not have a need for a liquid investment. Investing in private placements requires high-risk tolerance, low liquidity concerns, and long-term commitments. These investments are only suitable for the types of investors described above and who are familiar with and willing to accept the high risk associated with such investments. Private placement investments are NOT bank deposits (and thus NOT insured by the FDIC or by any other federal governmental agency). These investments are NOT guaranteed by Peloton Street or WealthForge, and MAY lose value. Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any federal or state securities commission or regulatory authority has recommended or approved any investment and/or the accuracy or completeness of any of the information or materials provided on the Peloton Street website or other services. Investors must be able to afford the loss of their entire investment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Investors are expressly advised to conduct their own due diligence, and are encouraged to consult with a financial advisor, attorney, accountant, and any other professional that can help you to understand and assess the risks associated with this or any other investment opportunity.
                </p>
