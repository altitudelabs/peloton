                    <h3>What is “Peloton” Street?</h3>
                    <p>
                        A term oftentimes synonymous with cycling, Peloton, refers to the integrated unit cyclists form when traveling in a group, similar in some respects to birds flying in formation. A peloton is formed to help individuals save energy - leveraging the resources of others to lengthen the stamina and endurance of the group. Simply put, the group achieves more working together than alone.

                    <p>
                        When translating this concept to investing… real estate…and financial returns… we think this idea is something to get truly excited about.

                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <h3>Building Peloton Street</h3>
                    <p>
                        Peloton Street was created to provide unprecedented access to real estate investment opportunities and the tools to make it easy and simple to select, analyze, and feel comfortable completing a real estate investment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At Peloton Street, we believe that all investors – no matter how big or small - deserve the opportunity to not only invest in real estate professionally, but to invest alongside highly skilled asset managers specifically assigned to monitor an investment’s performance and look after your best interest.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our business model is reminiscent of the real estate syndication or private placement business that real estate dealmakers have been putting together through private channels for decades. We function as principals in the deal (not as agents), which motivates us to remain engaged in the investment process and look after our investors' best interests in good times and bad – we make money when you make money.

                    <p>
                        We believe the only logical way to invest in real estate is with proven industry leaders working on your side. Peloton Street is led by respected industry leaders with a strong investment track record in creating value for private and institutional investors. Our leadership team has worked together for more than 5 years, advised on $68 billion of transactions, and managed a $23 billion portfolio of financial investments involving over $120 billion of commercial real estate. With the JOBS Act creating new opportunities for accredited investors and dealmakers, we have decided to apply our hands-on expertise and launch a new entrepreneurial venture that will let everyone (not just the experts) invest in real estate professionally.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By leveraging our extensive track record and network in the industry, we are able to provide unprecedented access to pre-vetted investment opportunities with best-in-class real estate operators from across the country.

More recently, he was a Senior Advisor in the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, when FTI was selected by the Unsecured Creditors to represent them as class holders of the “fulcrum security” in the liquidation of the failed investment bank. In this role, he executed over $4.3 billion of new investment to acquire distressed debt, execute value-add/opportunistic real estate strategies, and restructure legacy capital structures to harvest over $10 billion in longer-term incremental value. Tabish earned his BS from The Wharton School (W’98) and his MBA from Columbia University (CBS’05). He is an avid spin cyclist, bona fide technology geek, and lives in New York City with his wife and son.
