                                For years, savvy real estate dealmakers have been putting together these types of deals through private channels, unavailable to the general public. Lucky for you, recent changes in government regulation has dramatically changed real estate companies can raise capital for new projects allowing us to provide you with this safe and legal investment alternative.

                                Our business model is reminiscent of the real estate syndication or private placement business that real estate dealmakers have been putting together through private channels for decades. Peloton Street markets investments and pools investors’ monies into a Special Purpose Vehicle (“SPV”, such as an LLC)that makes a single investment into the deals that the crowd selects. We function as principals in the deal (not as agents), which motivates us to remain engaged in the investment process and look after our investors' best interests in good times and bad.

                                Peloton Street was founded in 2013 by a team of real estate industry veterans with significant deal execution experience and a proven track record for creating valuing in the real estate, financial services, and healthcare industries. Together, most notably, our founders have collectively advised on more than $65 billion (yes, billion) of real estate investment banking transactions and have separately managed over $20 billion dollars as investment professionals, during which time they developed several key valuation drivers and standardized return metrics, applicable to any deal size, and understandable to any investor. <a href="/team" title="Team">Learn more here</a>.

                                As you may know, crowdfunding provides the opportunity for real estate operators to raise funds by soliciting investment opportunities to a group of investors. Rather than buying the entire property, investors avoid the nuances of everyday property ownership, while still benefiting from the financial upside potential of real estate investing. Crowdinvesting is a similar strategy to crowdfunding, but considered to be the more “investor-focused” aspect of the crowdfunding space. While crowdfunding is tailored to the fundraiser, crowdinvesting is specifically tailored to you, the investor.

                                Crowdfunding has been used for generations and is a very familiar concept in Europe; however, it has yet to fully catch on in the US. The idea of “investment crowdfunding” was proposed in 2012 when Title II of the JOBS Act and proposed modifications to preexisting legal framework in the Securities Act of 1933. These changes were formalized and became operative in 2013, when the SEC lifted a century-long ban as to how companies can "generally" solicit and raise capital for projects from accredited investors. This relax in regulation has paved the way for a variety of crowdsourcing sites across almost every industry

                                An accredited investor is an individual that has made $200,000 for the past two years or who combined with a spouse has made $300,000 per year and has an expected income in the current year of at least these levels. Alternatively, an individual can qualify as an accredited investor if you have a net worth of $1 million or more, excluding your primary residence. <a href="https://www.sec.gov/answers/accred.htm" title="SEC: Accredited Investor Definition" target="_blank">See here for a complete definition of an accredited investor</a>.

                                We personally vet the track record and reputation of each Sponsor allowed to join our site. Peloton Street is unique in that we will not serve as the “central authority” that filters and vet individual projects marketed by these Sponsors before the public is even given an opportunity to see a deal. We will rely on the crowd to conduct due diligence together and commit to projects they like best. Peloton Street will become involved in finalizing the structure and provide its opinion on after a deal has gained sufficient traction on our site. Peloton Street is building proprietary software that will allow investors to crowdsource the due diligence of deals like the investment marketplace has never seen before.

                                Yes. Similar to investing in the stock market, there is no guarantee when you invest in real estate. The real estate market has economic cycles and it is difficult to know how and when the economy will change. Please bear in mind that the securities and investments found on Peloton Street are high-risk, but can be high-return as well. The beauty is that an investment in real estate is a tangible asset that rarely ever becomes “zero,” unless a deal is structured with high leverage as we had seen during the real estate crash. That's where we come in. Peloton Street helps mitigate this risk for its investors, by creating deal structures our interests will be aligned with that of our investors. We serve alongside you as principals in every deal. Our founding team has a tremendous amount of workout and restructuring experience providing you with a built-in set of advisors with real world experience. Our asset management services are available to our members throughout the entire investment lifecycle.

                                People invest in real estate for a variety of reasons, the majority being the desire to achieve financial freedom and control. Investments in real estate run the gamut. Some may offer passive income depending on the type of deal, while others may offer the opportunity to earn high returns. In the end of the day,real estate investors should always be mindful that land is of limited quantity and represents a solid, tangible asset - like gold!Unlike the stock market,these assets cannot disappear overnight. Although property values may change and risks are inherent(just as with any type of investing),the need for real estate will never go away. People will always need a place to live and work. Companies will always need a place to conduct business and store inventory. An investment in real estate through Peloton Street can provide a level of security and financial flexibility that will not require active monitoring or decision-making on your part.

                                The Peloton Street marketplace provides you with greater control over your real estate portfolio. When you choose to invest in a REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust), you are essentially investing in a real estate company that buys, manages, and sells real estate. A REIT is not an efficient way to make a direct investment in a specific property; and, as an investor in a REIT, you will be inherently bound by the decisions of the management team that chooses properties and makes investment decisions on your behalf. Crowd-investing isNOT meant to be a COMPLETE REPLACEMENT for how your portfolio may be invested in REITs," but rather an alternative that you may consider IN ADDITION TOto how you allocate investment dollars and portfolio resources to maintain exposure to "real estate" as an investment asset class. At Peloton Street, our investors will have the ability to individually analyze (or, have a representative do this on their behalf) and invest in specific properties, allowing for added transparency and control.

                                Our investment opportunities are structured into a series of Special Purpose Vehicles ("SPV") such as a Limited Liability Company ("LLC") in which our investors are can purchase shares in individual properties. Investor’s capital is pooled into a single purpose LLC and that LLC provides a single investment into the opportunity. An LLC provides limited liability protection for our investors, while streamlining the reporting and distribution processes. This is a fairly common strategy in the world of real estate investing and most crowdfunding companies are taking this same approach.
                            </p>

                                One advantage to investing with Peloton Street is that we specifically structure the deals as partnerships with real estate operators in which our founding team serves as principals for each transaction (not as an agent)this provides you, as the investors, with someone to look after your best interest from investment acquisition to disposition.

                                Each LLC is governed by a document called an “operating agreement”. While every operating agreement is slightly different, our deal are typically structured as a partnership between the real estate operator and the founders of Peloton Street who serve as the manager and limited members (investors). The managers represent a team of highly skilled asset managers who are assigned to monitor the investment's performance and look after your best interest. We are highly experienced in this capacity and since we have a “carried interest” in each deal, we make money when you make money.
                            </p>

                                We believe this to be an optimal structure for our members providing you with a passive real estate investment and an alignment of interests between us as the manager and you as the limited member.

                                Nothing will change from a numbers perspective – only structurally. For equity investments, Peloton Street could be replaced by another asset manager such as a national bank or trust company, to manage the LLCs in the event Peloton Street is unable to manage them. For debt investments, Peloton Street could be replaced by a loan servicing company in the event Peloton Street is unable to manage them.

                                The opportunities that you will find on Peloton Street are private investment transactions in physical properties around theUnited States. The investments by their very nature have a longer term time horizon than that of liquid stocks or bonds. These hold periods could range from 1-10+ years depending on when the investment is disposed/harvested, refinanced, or the loan is paid off. Our investors are provided with a detailed business plan and projections that will identify the expected timeline for the investment. We encourage our investors to review and get comfortable with this timeline, which may include additional distributions during the investment lifecycle including profit distributions (as an equity investor) or interest payments (as a debt investors).

The transfer price would be mutually agreed- upon and based upon a third-party valuation.

                                The JOBS Act was signed into law on April 5, 2012 by President Obama; Title II of the JOBS Act became effective on Sept. 23, 2013 and Title III is under an SEC rule making review. Title II of the JOBS Act,which modified the preexisting legal framework known as “Regulation D” in the Securities Act of 1933, enables private companies like Peloton Street to "generally solicit" accredited investors using social media, Internet and traditional advertising. Eventually, Title III of the JOBS Act will become operative and enable investment crowdfunding for all investors, both accredited and non-accredited. We look forward to watching this rule making process continue and working to understand how it will impact our business model.

                                There is a lot of "buzz" around crowdfunding and how it is impacting or will impact real estate investing. Honestly speaking, the industry as a whole is so new that the "jury is still out" trying to determine a verdict; however, companies in this space are currently only able to solicit “accredited investors” or "qualified purchasers" by relying on how Title II of the JOBS Act has modified the preexisting legal framework known as “Regulation D” in the Securities Act of 1933. Regulation D Rule 506(c), which became operative in September 2013, is new and allows a private company to solicit accredited investors using social media, Internet and traditional advertising. There’s no limit on how much an accredited investors can commit to deals under this structure. Title III of the JOBS Act, which is still under SEC rule making review, has proposed adding a new section to the Securities Act that will allow for "true crowdfunding" of transactions by allowing non-accredited investors to participate. There’s also Regulation A and the pending Regulation A+. Regulation A allows an issuer to raise $5mover a rolling 12month period from"local investors," without having to file a registration with the SEC and, in some cases, individual state regulators. These investors must be domiciled in and the adjacent states where the transaction is located or issuer is based. Regulation A is considered a low threshold with a lot of effort, which is why the SEC and state regulators are considering Regulation A+, where issuers will be able to raise $50 million but with greater investment protections. Finally, there’s an S-1, which is the strategy used by Lending Club used and is similar to an IPO.

                        <h4 class="toggle-anchor">Are we regulated by the SEC, FINRA, and/or separate branch of the government? How is Peloton Street legally structured?</h4>

                                You betcha! Peloton Street has taken a very conservative approach to its regulatory strategy, in an effort to provide deal makers and investors with the safest and best-in-class crowdinvesting platform available today. We are not only structured as a "private equity fund" relying on exemptions under the Investment Company Act of 1940 that will issue its own exempt securities under Regulation D Rule 506(b) and 506(c), but also the co-founders of Peloton Street are registered representatives of a broker-dealer in good standing with the SEC, FINRA, and member of the SIPC.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our affiliation with a broker-dealer will help Peloton Street govern the entire solicitation process, compliance, and provide a legal framework for us to be able to collect certain fees and reimbursements for deal expenses. More strategically, we appreciate the robust regulatory framework that is already in place by the SEC and FINRA for broker-dealers and the economic scale that can be achieved by creating such a best-in-class platform. Many of our competitors believe that the only way to run a "truly compliant shop" is to be associated with a broker-dealer - and we agree. Peloton Street subscribes to the fact that real estate investors will (and should) feel more comfortable in investing with a broker-dealer and this will eventually become a prerequisite for Venture Capital investors looking at crowdfunding platforms. Furthermore, Peloton Street will initially also be able to rely on the "private fund exemption" in the Investment Adviser Act of 1940 until it has $150 million assets (i.e. investments) under management.
